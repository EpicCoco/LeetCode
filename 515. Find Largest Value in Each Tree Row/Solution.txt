https://leetcode.com/problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row/description/
My first intuition was to use BFS, but then decided to do
a more DFS-like apprroach using recursion. I keep track of
the current level in the recursive call and keep updated
max values in an array. the DFS hits every node and so at
the end of the program, the overall max values per level
are in the array.
