https://leetcode.com/problems/find-in-mountain-array/description/
My idea was to use three binary searches, one to find the peak of the mountain array and two more to search either side of the mountain.
Since I'm using binary search, which is O(log(n)), and there are 10,000 elements max, I will use no more than:
3 * log base 2 (10,000) = 39
This fits within the criteria of the problem, plus some wiggle room for my actual solution.
