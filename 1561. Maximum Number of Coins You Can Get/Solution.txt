For this problem, you can always group a triplet with
the smallest value for Bob. You also always group
a large number for Alice, followed by a slightly 
smaller number for yourself. With this in mind, you
can sort the array, skip the first third, and take
every other item (which is like taking the second
largest item if you had constructed a triplet).
