leetcode.com/problems/count-nice-pairs-in-an-array/
For this problem, I make a separate array that
tracks the difference in a number and its
reverse. I sort that to put all the pairs
together and make my count with that. The count
is determined by the number of elements
converted to the nth triangle number (factorial
for addition), and add that to the total.
