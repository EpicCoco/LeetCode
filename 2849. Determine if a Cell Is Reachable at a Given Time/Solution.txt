I figured that, unless the start and finsih are overlapping, the 
easiest way to figure this problem out was to get to the finish
as fast as possible and waste any extra moves. I do this by first
travelling diagonally towards the finish, then horizontally/
vertically. This is the most efficent path one can make in this
problem. Then waste any extra moves.
