https://leetcode.com/problems/last-moment-before-all-ants-fall-out-of-a-plank/
The big intuition on this problem is that ants bouncing off of
each other does not really matter - an ant is still going to 
go in both of the original directions with no additional cost.
Therefore one is just looking for the ant farthest from the
dropoff point.
